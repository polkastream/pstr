# Project Description
[Polkastream](https://polkastream.io/) is poised to be the next innovative addition to the [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/) parachain system by building an integrated and intelligently monetized platform for the Web 3.0 streaming and gaming industry. On the Polkastream platform, users can listen to music and podcasts, watch movies and TV shows, as well as socialize and play games in the [Polkaverse](https://linktr.ee/polkaverse). In return, they are rewarded with the PSTR token, which is uniquely designed with incentivization and token-burning strategies for better rewards, long-term crypto market stability, and data security for all digital media users.

# Token Utilities
PSTR is the utility token of the Polkastream platform, where users can earn immersive rewards by listening to music and podcasts, watching movies and TV shows, and/or socializing and playing over 40 games in the Polkaverse. PSTR can also be staked in one of the various staking programs for an APY interest.

Most importantly, PSTR is the governance token of the Polkastream Decentralized Autonomous Organization (PDAO), where users can create proposals and vote on the current ones using PSTR to make any changes to the Polkastream Web 3.0 OTT (over-the-top) streaming and Metaverse gaming protocol.

# Solidproof.io Security and Tokenomics Audit
[github.com/solidproof/projects/blob/main/Polkastream/SmartContract_Audit_Solidproof_Polkastream.pdf](https://github.com/solidproof/projects/blob/main/Polkastream/SmartContract_Audit_Solidproof_Polkastream.pdf)


# Tokenomics
PSTR is minted on [Binance Smart Chain (BSC)](https://www.bnbchain.org/) with an initial maximum supply of one billion (1,000,000,000) tokens.

For passive income, PSTR is built with an Automated Rewards Farming (ARF) feature that includes:

- A 4% fee is automatically applied to all transactions, from which 3% is distributed to holders, and the remaining 1%, up to 50% of the max supply, is permanently burned.
- After 50% of the initial maximum supply is burned, the fee reverts to 4% with all of it distributed to holders and 0% burned.

As an added token security and stability feature, PSTR has a limit of one million (1,000,000) tokens per transaction. This anti-slippage transaction limit is updateable through Polkastream Decentralized Autonomous Organization (PDAO) proposals made by the Polkastream Community.


### Wallet Distributions
The smart contract deploys one billion PSTR tokens to the following wallets, which are excluded from paying fees, receiving dividends, and a per transaction limit.

### Disclaimers
- There is only one PSTR smart contract address on BSC and no other blockchains, including Polkadot. Here it is again: [bscscan.com/address/0x3cdd71d99cb393928b74d549d4cb0a6ffe0a60a8](https://bscscan.com/address/0x3cdd71d99cb393928b74d549d4cb0a6ffe0a60a8). Please always confirm it before making any investment decisions.

- Until official announcements are made, the PSTR token cannot be bought or traded on any platform, whether it be a centralized exchange (CEX), a decentralized exchange (DEX), or a launchpad. The official Polkastream social media channels are accessible at https://polkastream.io, and all announcements of investment and/or pre-sale opportunities will be made via those socials. Anyone claiming that you can purchase PSTR otherwise is an impersonator. Be careful and aware of potential scammers. 

- 100% of the PSTR token supply in the company’s possession will always be stored in the most secure and effective air-gapped wallet currently available in the market. This should provide complete security and safety from hacks, as air-gapped wallets are never connected to the internet and, therefore, cannot be hacked digitally.

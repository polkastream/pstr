# Tokenomics
PSTR is minted off Binance Smart Chain (BSC) With a maximum supply of one billion (1,000,000,000) tokens. 

For passive income, PSTR is built in with Automated Rewards Farming (ARF) to include:

- A 4% fee is automatically applied to all transactions. 3% of that fee is distributed to holders and the remaining 1%, up to 50% of the max supply, is permanently burned.
- After the 50% supply is burned, the fee reverts to 4% with all of it distributed to holders and 0% burned. 

As an added token security and stability feature, PSTR has a limit of one million (1,000,000) tokens per transaction. This anti-slippage transaction limit is updateable through Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) proposals made by the Polkastream Community.
